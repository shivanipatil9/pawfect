Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations, or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms and Conditions will in no way affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms and Conditions. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified. These Terms and Conditions represent the entire agreement between THE PAWFECT DATE and Pet Owner.
